# unity-2d-project
This is a 2D game (final project) for my Unity scripting class.

I'm currently working on this, but the code I have posted now allows my three animated sprites (Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury, and Sailor Venus)
to move around the scene together and "jump" with 1, 2, or 3 keyboard inputs. They can jump together or separately, and their jumps
don't look weird or out-of-sync.

I used a state machine (inspired by a chapter in Bob Nystrom's Game Programming Patterns book) to control their movement.
